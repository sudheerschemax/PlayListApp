Playlist Challenge
==========================

> Build a single page web application for creating playlists from a library of
> songs!

Included in this folder is a Node.js web server which includes an API and a
skeleton for your browser-based playlist application.

The API includes endpoints to complete the challenge. You don't need to change,
but you can if it helps.

feel free to get idea from spotify app and make your test prettier.(you can find the picture in the root directory).
feel free to use react or create-react-app to complete task or you can add react to this project.
feel free to use any css librarries but if you use custom css will have extra points.

To install and start the web server (Tested with node v12.13, npm v6.12):

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Features
-----------------------------

Start by building out these features:

Frontend:
1. Load the library of songs and show it in the browser. 
2. Add songs from the library to a playlist. 
3. Name and save a playlist.
4. List saved playlists. 
5. Load saved playlists.
6. Search/filtering for songs.
7. Search for a particular entry/song criteria (ie: music length, by artist, by genre, etc) from the backend GraphQL API.


FrontEnd : React(TypeScript) with Ant Design UI design language and React UI library with a set of high-quality React components,

Backend:
1. Change the simple express REST API with GraphQL API.
2. Design and implement GraphQL query and resolver. Think of it as you are loading the data from database instead of hardcoded JS Object.
3. Design and implement GraphQL mutation query.
